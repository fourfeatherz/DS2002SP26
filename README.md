# DS2002 — Data Science Systems (Spring 2026) — Workflow

Welcome to DS2002. This repo is **your official record of work** for DS2002.

- **Do all coding/analysis in Kaggle Notebooks.**
- **Turn in links to your repos in Canvas.**
- Use this GitHub repo to **version, organize, and present** your work professionally.

---

## Quick Start (What you do every week)

1. **Open the week’s notebook in Kaggle** (We will usually go over in class).
2. Do the work in Kaggle.
3. **Download the notebook (`.ipynb`) from Kaggle** when you’re ready to submit.
4. Put the file in the correct folder in this repo.
5. **Commit + push**.
6. Submit your **GitHub repo link (and Kaggle link if asked)** in Canvas.

## Non‑Negotiables (Read this once, save yourself pain)

### Kaggle-only
Kaggle is the *official* environment for this course.  
If you choose to run elsewhere, you’re on your own for debugging environment issues.

### Canvas is the system of record
Grades, due dates, submissions, and feedback live in **Canvas**.

### Teams is for conversation
Questions go to the **Teams channels** (perferable over email) since others can learn from you.  
DMs are for private things you need to let me know about.

## File & Notebook Naming (Follow this exactly)

Every notebook in this course uses:

`YYYY-MM-DD — Topic — Type.ipynb`

Where **Type** is one of:
- `Lecture` (my examples in class)
- `Studio` (guided in-class build Usually on Wednesday)
- `Lab` (Friday hands-on)
- `Homework` (weekend extension)
- `Template` (project scaffold)

Example:
- `2026-02-04 — Pandas Core Ops (filter, groupby, join) — Studio.ipynb`

**Why we do this:** it stays readable *and* sorts correctly everywhere.

---

## What to Submit (Most common question)

Unless Canvas says otherwise, you submit:

1. **Your GitHub repo link** 
2. The `.ipynb` file(s) for the assignment in the correct folder
3. A short write-up in Markdown **inside the notebook**

For projects, you also submit:
- a **project README** (use the template in `templates/`)
- any small supporting artifacts (charts, exports, etc.)

---

## Notebook Hygiene (How to avoid “it worked on my machine”)

Before submitting any notebook:

- Restart kernel
- **Run All**
- Make sure the notebook runs top-to-bottom without errors
- Make sure outputs are present (plots, tables, printed results)
- Add short Markdown explanations between major steps

If you submit a notebook that doesn’t run, it will be graded as-is.

## Repo Structure (Where things go)

- `notebooks/01-foundations/`  
  Notebook basics, Python fundamentals, GitHub workflow, submission standards

- `notebooks/02-sql-databases/`  
  SQL + SQLite inside notebooks

- `notebooks/03-pandas-json-apis/`  
  Pandas foundations, JSON normalization, API ingestion

- `notebooks/04-etl-walmart/`  
  ETL templates + Walmart case framing

- `notebooks/05-midterm-walmart-mini-project/`  
  Midterm project artifacts (starter, checkpoint, final)

- `notebooks/06-capstone/`  
  Capstone artifacts (starter, checkpoint, final)

- `notebooks/07-visualization-communication/`  
  Visualization for decisions + communicating uncertainty

- `notebooks/08-wrap-up/`  
  Reflection + final takeaways

- `templates/`  
  README templates, project scaffolds, submission checklists

- `rubrics/`  
  Grading rubrics

- `data/sample/`  
  Tiny sample data only (do not commit large datasets)

## How to Export from Kaggle (30 seconds)

In Kaggle:
1. Open your notebook
2. Click **File** → **Download notebook**
3. Move the `.ipynb` into the correct folder in this repo
4. Commit & push

Tip: keep a consistent commit message pattern, e.g.:
- `Lab 2: API ingestion`
- `HW 3: Pagination + retries`
- `Midterm checkpoint`

---

## Collaboration Rules (Short and clear)

- You may collaborate as allowed by the assignment.
- You may discuss approaches and debug together.
- You may NOT copy/paste someone else’s finished notebook or text UNLESS you are working in a group. I'll let you know when.

When in doubt: ask in Teams.

---

## Need help?

- Ask in **Teams** first (so others benefit)
- If it’s personal/private: DM the me

---

## Templates you should use

- Project README template: `templates/PROJECT_README_TEMPLATE.md`
- Submission checklist: `templates/SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`
